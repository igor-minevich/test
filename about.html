I was born in Dnepropetrvosk, Ukraine. (The name Dnepropetrovsk has now been Ukrainianized (from Russian) to Dnipropetrovs'k.). I came to the United States on August 23, 1997. I speak English most comfortably, Russian fluently, and a little bit of Hebrew and Ukrainian.</p>

<p> I did my undergraduate work at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), majoring in mathematics and minoring in computer science and physics. I married Natasha Arora on May 28, 2012. I received my Ph.D. at Brown University in May 2014. My hobbies include yoga, meditation, playing piano, logic puzzles, knitting, painting (I was 99% sure I could never make a decent painting until I went to <a href="https://www.paintnite.com/">Paint Nite</a> so I highly encourage everyone to <a href="https://www.paintnite.com/">go!</a>), chess, dancing (esp. Rumba and West Coast Swing!), table tennis, racquetball, badminton, and anything <a href="http://www.dunenovels.com/">Dune</a>-related.</p>
